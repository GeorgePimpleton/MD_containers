# Multi-dimensional containers with C++
[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B-blue)](https://github.com/GeorgePimpleton/modules_testing/)
### Why this github repository exists
To show my "take" on how to use MD containers, std::vectors, and how to ease into displaying an MD vector with custom templates.

### Compiler used
I use Visual Studio 2022 (Community) to create and test the code, setting the C++ language standard to /std:c++latest (C++23 features).  This works even for pre-C++20 code.

You should think about using VS 2022 as well.  It's free for the Community edition.
